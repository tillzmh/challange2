                    <p>My Name is Lawrence Tillery. I graduated college in 2014 with a Industral Technology Degree in the school of Science and Engineering. I started my IT career in 2015 starting on the Help Desk Team for Northwell Health and moved my way up to a Desktop Technician. After 8 years with the company I had left the company and became a Level Two Escalating Technician for Nordstrom. Since receiving my BA I always had an intrest in learning how to code. I tried the self teaching way but for some reason I could not grasp the idea. I then started to do reseach on different bootcamps and came across Columbia Bootcamp and applied. Once accepted I was back to trying to teach myslef so I can prepare myself for this course. During this course I plan on expanding my skills in the tech field and move onto the next level of my career. I am excited to embark on this new journey and waitng to see what doors are going to open for me once completed.</p>
